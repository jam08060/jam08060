Hi, I’m jam08060

Here are a few things about me in order of usefulness:

- I'm a Computer Engineer with a passion for big data, functional programming, and computer security.
- My favorite programming book is 'Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!' http://learnyouahaskell.com/
- I love bears, but I do not like beets or Battlestar Galactica.
